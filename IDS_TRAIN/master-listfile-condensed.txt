LL - Detection Scoring Truth

This is a listing of all attacks in the two weeks of test data, weeks 4 and
5. Each attack has been assigned a unique ID number of the format:
WD-HHMMSS. That is, the ID number 41.083456 would indicate: 'Week 4, Day 1
(Monday), at 08:34:56'. The time specified in the ID number is to be used
only as a rough indicator of when the attack took place.

Exact information about where the attack occurs is given by summarized
listfile entries for each attack. These entries are summarized in that if
there are several sessions of a single attack that overlap in time (and
victim) then they are aggregated and listed at a single listfile entry here.
Non-summarized froms of the listfile entry for each attack can be found by
clicking the hyper-linked attack ID number.

What follows is the Truth as used in the detection scoring phase of the 1999
Evaluation. For the Identification scoring "Truth" try here.
