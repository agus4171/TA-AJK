WASHINGTON -- Russian Foreign Minister Primakov told CNN today that Russia<br>
rejects the U.S. intention to enforce sanctions on countries that defied<br>
the D'Amato Act. <br>
<p>
	"No nation may claim the right to impose sanctions on another<br>
country's trade policy without full consultation and agreement among UN<br>
members," said the foreign minister. <br>
<p>
	Mr. Primakobv went on to point out that such a move would do<br>
little to help combat terrorism. The foreign minister attributed<br>
President Clinton's aggressive stance against terrorism as an attempt to<br>
forestall competitive investment by other countries while enabling US<br>
economy to dominate the international market.<br>
<p>
	President Clinton had announced four days ago of his intention to<br>
impose sanctions on European countries that had invested more than $40<br>
million in Iran or Libya. <br>
<p>
	President Clinton was unavailable for comment.<br>
<p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, in response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin<br>
Netanyahu's offer to withdraw troops from Southern Lebanon in exchange<br>
with peace from Lebanon, Islamic Militant group Hezbollah said that it<br>
would not change its position against the State of Israel unless the<br>
situation of Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and South Lebanon were<br>
discussed. <br>
<p>
	Hezbollah stated that it desired complete liberation of the<br>
afore-mentioned areas. Hezbollah also indicated that they were still<br>
waiting for the terms of such a pre-proposed treaty to be presented, to<br>
know what it was exactly that Israel wants and what it will give in<br>
return.<br>

<p>
Victor, if you do look at Schaub, then make sure to look at Dewey's response<br>
(Schillp, p. 594-7; LW 14:77-80).  Schaub, like Randall, thinks Dewey could<br>
have been more accommodating of traditional religion.  Another dissenter<br>
from the Deweyan approach is Milton Konvitz, who wrote the intro to LW 9,<br>
which contains the text of A Common Faith.  Konvitz contends, contra Dewey,<br>
that there is an autonomous religious experience (p. xxvii).<br>

 *  reallocate_matrix() may not be called after reallocate_matrix_noncontig()
 *  reallocate_matrix_noncontig() will produce a warning if called to shrink
 *	a matrix.  The matrix will be untouched and no associated memory
 *	will be freed
 * EXAMPLE:
 *	float **pfloat;
 *	pfloat = allocate_matrix(10, 100);
 *	...
 *	pfloat = reallocate_matrix_noncontig(pfloat, 10, 100, 20);

Grant,<br>
<p>
  In response to your questions on wool leggins. I made mine out of a pair<br>
of navy drop fronts that had a big rip in the butt.  The surplus store<br>
where I got them said being worthless, I would have to give them two bucks<br>
for them. When I got them home, I ripped them apart at the seams and cut<br>
off the legs so they would resemble plains leggins. then hand stitched the<br>
seams with a welt of fringe of the same material. They attatch with<br>
buckskin thongs to a thin vegatable tanned leather belt that I use in<br>
summer for my skin legggins, and that's about it.  I wear them over my<br>
amish made wool dropfronts in really cold weather and in the fall or<br>
spring, by themselves with my red breechclout. I'd say that looks American<br>
enough! The red clout, blue legs and white skin! I have friends who use<br>
blanket wool for leggins too. The most important thing for winter travel<br>
still has to be the ability to layer yourself. So I like  to wear alot of<br>
thin layers, allowing me to shed or add as needed.<br>
<p>
To all interested in such things,<br>
                   I just returned from the NMLRA Wintervoo. Although<br>
billed as a shoot, we had a good contingent of AMM. some of the things<br>
discussed, politics aside, were the documentation and liberal<br>
experimentation of Shrub. Rex Norman brought a few gallons with him on<br>
friday. this lasted approxemetely one hour. I was off at the mall (traders<br>
row) for a little while. when I returned Rex and Candoo had finished almost<br>
two thirds of the stuff and were forced into perpetual grinning mode. Not<br>
too waste any time I proceeded to catch up with the remainder. Apple Pie,<br>
Cherry Bounce and trade whisky be damned! We now have shrub by god! Another<br>
close friend by name of Jim Mahoney who lived in Phoenix was then forced at<br>
that point to return for more lemons from his grove to last the next two<br>
nights. Now  the recipie as you will remember is one quart acid citrus<br>
juice (in our case lemons), one cup brown sugar ( this insures a two day<br>
hangover), two cups water, and one quart dark spanish rum (Chateau Safeway<br>
'96 I believe). mix all thouroughly in a large tin kettle. be sure to leave<br>
in the lemon rinds, Age for thirty seconds (less if you're really thirsty)<br>
and pass said kettle copiously to anyone within reach, touting the true<br>
authenticity for the fur trade.<br>
<p>
Another subject which we have started crusading on is the historical<br>
innacuracy of the word "Trek". Seems the original use of this word came<br>
douwn (or up) from South Africa in the 1840's, when they were in the middle<br>
of their northward migration at the same time we were having a westward<br>
one. This came to be known as the great trek and the modern use of the word<br>
was born. Nowwhere, and I challange all comers to prove me wrong, is the<br>
word trek used in any fur trade journal or narrative. Therefore, we are at<br>
this juncture, on a new crusade to obliterate this improper word from the<br>
collective vocabulary of the AMM to start with, then, the world! Ha Ha Ha<br>
Ha (ooops got carried away).   So, what do we replace it with as the new<br>
standard byword you ask? We came up with many possiblities.  Travel... too<br>
simple. Journada... too deadly. voyage...too nautical. Walk...doesnt apply<br>
to horse travel. Expedition...too Fremont. Adventure... too sensationalist.<br>
Jaunt..jaunt.hmmn... We like it!  Yes JAUNT! Ruxton went on many Jaunts<br>
through the southwest with the mountain men! JAUNT it is! in fact we liked<br>
it so much we are now thinking of starting a new group called the Calition<br>
of Historical Jaunters! All you need to do to join is Spread the word!<br>
whenever the word Trek comes out of someones mouth, tell them of our<br>
revalation! Not trek ya idjit! JAUNT!!!   I jaunt, they jaunted, we are<br>
jaunting! Ya hear that, Baker?!!!<br>
<p>
Aint history fun!<br>
<p>
I remaine yer most humble and o'bedt s'vant<br>

Greetings,


All good things must come to an end, and so too must the first
version of the mmCIF dictionary.  We are pleased to announce that 
version 0.9.0 of the dictionary  has been forwarded to COMCIFS for 
review.  Many thanks to all of you for your contributions to creation 
of what we hope will shortly become version 1.0.

Cheers,

Helen Berman

<EM>&gt; Who fired the first shots in the War between the States?</EM><br>
<P>
The Confederates fired at a ship invading it's territorial waters to<BR>
bring ammo and supplies to the troops holding a fort on Confederate<BR>
soil.  That way, the yanKees could use the sophomoric argument that<BR>
the Confederate States of America fired first so they were justified<BR>
in laying waste to her country.<BR>

WASHINGTON -- It has been three days since United States President Bill Clinton invited<br>
Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to Camp David. The invitation to join the<br>
President there was extended in an effort to further relations and peace-keeping efforts<br>
in the Middle East.<br>
    President Clinton nominated the topics for the discussion to include security measures<br>
in accordance to the Oslo 2 agreements, the future political status of Palestinians,<br>
Jerusalem and the issue of Palestinian refugees. He also mentioned in a press release held<br>
earlier this week that the delegates would be allowed full interaction with other parties<br>
and the media.<br>
    Neither party has yet replied to the invitation, and as yet the intentions of both<br>
parties to accept the offer has not been known.<br>
    Also unknown is the response from Lebanon and Syria regarding Israel's offer to<br>
withdraw troops in Southern Lebanon in exchange for peace. The Israeli troops stationed<br>
themselves in Southern Lebanon in 1985, after invading Lebanon in 1982.<br>

WASHINGTON -- It has been three days since United States President Bill Clinton invited<br>
Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to Camp David. The invitation to join the<br>
President there was extended in an effort to further relations and peace-keeping efforts<br>
in the Middle East.<br>
    President Clinton nominated the topics for the discussion to include security measures<br>
in accordance to the Oslo 2 agreements, the future political status of Palestinians,<br>
Jerusalem and the issue of Palestinian refugees. He also mentioned in a press release held<br>
earlier this week that the delegates would be allowed full interaction with other parties<br>
and the media.<br>
    Neither party has yet replied to the invitation, and as yet the intentions of both<br>
parties to accept the offer has not been known.<br>
    Also unknown is the response from Lebanon and Syria regarding Israel's offer to<br>
withdraw troops in Southern Lebanon in exchange for peace. The Israeli troops stationed<br>
themselves in Southern Lebanon in 1985, after invading Lebanon in 1982.<br>

# NAME:	     explot.pl 
# PURPOSE:   create plot showing events in many .ex files 
# USAGE:  explot.pl xmin xmax xstep prefix 'file-glob'
# EXAMPLES:
# ONE WORK DAY:
#			explot.pl 6.0 18.0 2.0 programmer 'programmer*.ex'
# ONE WEEK:
#			explot.pl 0 168 24.0 programmer 'programmer*.ex'
# DESCRIPTION:
# Times are in hours.
# Creates a scatter plot where time in hours
# is the x axis and the y axis represents
# different user actions or commands that exist in a batch of
# ex files indicated on the command line using regular expressions.
# Remember to keep the shell from expanding the regular expression
# using quotes because perl does this in the script.
# The first argument is minimum time to plot (in hours), the second is 
# the maximum time to plot (in hours), the third is the time step
# for tick marks (in hours), the fourth is prefix used to name
# the plot file, and the last argument is 
# is a regular expression indicating which ex files to use in
# creating the plot.
# 
# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
# 	The plotted commands are built into the script 
#   The program prints out information including a list of
#   the ex files used as processing proceeds.

WASHINGTON -- In an exclusive discourse with CNN today, Lebanon President<br>
Elias Hrawi admitted his skepticism of Isreal's offer to withdraw troops<br>
from Southern Lebanon, even though he looks forward to the fulfillment of<br>
such a move from Israel.<br>
<p>
	President Hrawi indicated his curiousity as to whether Israel<br>
really intends to comply with previous UN resolutions or whether this is a<br>
bid by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to salvage his position<br>
and standing within his government.<br>
<p>
	Israel suffered no small amount of embarresment when recently two<br>
Mossad agents were apprehended while attempting to assassinate a high<br>
levelled HAMAS member in Jordan using Canadian passports. <br>
<p>
	President Hrawi noted that discourses were being held with other<br>
groups involved in this matter, including Syria, the Palestinian Authority<br>
and the Islamic Militant group known as Hezbollah.<br>
<p>
	"No group, in the interest of a lasting peace, should be left<br>
out of these talks, and their many conflicting demands reconciled before<br>
we approach the bargaining table."<br>
<p>
	At this present time, it is not known if Prime Minister Netanyahu<br>
has arranged for a specific date and time for talks to begin. Lebanon is<br>
still awaiting a formal invitation to talks from the Israeli government.<br>
<p>
	"I urge Mr. Netanyahu to eschew obsfucation of the current<br>
situation, and remain firm in his intent," said Mr. Hrawi.<br>

    an area my proposal. 
Here is some C code 

 *		column sizes
 *	- a vector of nrow pointers to floating point arrays is allocated and
 *		filled with the addresses of the rows in the matrix block.
 *	float **m, *v;
 *	m = allocate_matrix(nrow, ncol);
 *	v = m[i]; (0 <= i < nrow.  0 <= j < ncol)
 *	(v[j] == m[i][j])
 *	(&m[i][j] == &m[i][j-1] + sizeof(float))
 *	(&m[i][j] == &m[i-1][j] + nrow*sizeof(float))
 *
 *   float **reallocate_matrix(m, nrow, ncol, newrow)
 *	float **m; int nrow, ncol, newrow;
 *	- change the number of rows in a 2D float matrix allocated using
 *		allocate_matrix() using two calls to realloc, copy the data
 *		from m to the new matrix, initialize the new entries to 0.0,
 *		initialize the pointers to the matrix rows and return a
 *		pointer to the vector of matrix row pointers
 *	- a contiguous block of memory newrow*ncol*sizeof(float) bytes long is
 *		allocated
 *	- another contiguous block of memory newrow*sizeof(float *) is
 *		allocated
 *	- the data is initialized as follows:
 *		m2 = reallocate_matrix(m, nrow, ncol, newrow);
 *		m2[0][0]..m2[nrow-1][ncol-1] = m[0][0]..m[nrow-1][ncol-1];
 *		m2[nrow][0]..m2[newrow-1][ncol-1] = 0.0;
 *	- the new matrix has the same properties as the original, namely
 *		v = m2[i]; (0 <= i < newrow; 0 <= j < ncol)
 *		(v[j] == m2[i][j])
 *		(&m2[i][j] == &m2[i][j-1] + sizeof(float))
 *		(&m2[i][j] == &m2[i-1][j] + newrow*sizeof(float))
 *	- if m was set by a previous call to reallocate_matrix_noncontig(),
 *		a fatal error will result
 *
 *   float **reallocate_matrix_noncontig(m, nrow, ncol, newrow)
 *	float **m; int nrow, ncol, newrow;
 *	- increase the number of rows in a 2D float matrix allocated using
 *		allocate_matrix(), initializing the added rows to 0.0
 *		This routine is similar to reallocate_matrix().  The difference
 *		being that the space for the new data is allocated as a new
 *		data block, not attached to the rest of the matrix data.
 *		The old matrix data is not moved in memory, as it would be
 *		in reallocate_matrix().
 *		A new array of pointers (m[i]) is allocated, as before.
 *	- note: cannot be used to decrease the number of rows in a matrix,
 *		as reallocate_matrix can be.
 *
 *   void deallocate_matrix(m)
 *	float **m;
 *	- free space for a floating point matrix previously allocated by
 *		allocate_matrix().  Will free all blocks of data allocated
 *		during calls to reallocate_matrix_noncontig()
 *
 *   There are also routines for allocating vectors and matrices of doubles,
 *   integers, pointers, and structs.  Each works the same as its
 *   corresponding floating point version.
 *   The routine names are listed below.
 *
 *   doubles:
 *   double *allocate_dvector(), *reallocate_dvector();
 *   double **allocate_dmatrix(), **reallocate_dmatrix(),
 *	**reallocate_dmatrix_noncontig();
 *   void deallocate_dvector(), deallocate_dmatrix();
 *
 *   ints:
 *   int *allocate_ivector(), *reallocate_ivector();
 *   int **allocate_imatrix(), **reallocate_imatrix(),
 *	**reallocate_imatrix_noncontig();
 *   void deallocate_ivector(), deallocate_imatrix();
 *
 *   pointers:
 *   void **allocate_pvector(), **reallocate_pvector();
 *   void ***allocate_pmatrix(), ***reallocate_pmatrix(),
 *	***reallocate_pmatrix_noncontig();
 *   void deallocate_pvector(), deallocate_pmatrix();
 *
 *   structs:
 *   void *allocate_structvector(), *reallocate_structvector();
 *   void **allocate_structmatrix(), **reallocate_structmatrix();
 *	**reallocate_structmatrix_noncontig();
 *   void deallocate_structvector(), deallocate_structmatrix();

WASHINGTON -- In an exclusive discourse with CNN today, Lebanon President<br>
Elias Hrawi admitted his skepticism of Isreal's offer to withdraw troops<br>
from Southern Lebanon, even though he looks forward to the fulfillment of<br>
such a move from Israel.<br>
<p>
	President Hrawi indicated his curiousity as to whether Israel<br>
really intends to comply with previous UN resolutions or whether this is a<br>
bid by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to salvage his position<br>
and standing within his government.<br>
<p>
	Israel suffered no small amount of embarresment when recently two<br>
Mossad agents were apprehended while attempting to assassinate a high<br>
levelled HAMAS member in Jordan using Canadian passports. <br>
<p>
	President Hrawi noted that discourses were being held with other<br>
groups involved in this matter, including Syria, the Palestinian Authority<br>
and the Islamic Militant group known as Hezbollah.<br>
<p>
	"No group, in the interest of a lasting peace, should be left<br>
out of these talks, and their many conflicting demands reconciled before<br>
we approach the bargaining table."<br>
<p>
	At this present time, it is not known if Prime Minister Netanyahu<br>
has arranged for a specific date and time for talks to begin. Lebanon is<br>
still awaiting a formal invitation to talks from the Israeli government.<br>
<p>
	"I urge Mr. Netanyahu to eschew obsfucation of the current<br>
situation, and remain firm in his intent," said Mr. Hrawi.<br>

# This program processes all files on the command line to STDOUT; to process a

#  Version 1.1 12/6/94 -- Fixed minor bug which could unpredictably cause a

Come on, I thought us malayalees were more tolerant. You guys really<br>
disappoint me. Both the Maramon Convention and the Aranmula event are a part<br>
of our rich cultural and religious heritage. Christianity in Kerala, as you<br>
guys know, goes back to Jesus time and Hinduism even before. This NG was<br>
civil so far but for a moment I thought I was in sci or scp. For the record<br>
I am a Marthomite.<br>

;              Data items in the PHASING_MIR_DER_REFLN category record details
               about the calculated structure factors obtained in an MIR
               phasing experiment.

               This list may contain information from a number of different
               derivatives; _phasing_MIR_der_refln.der_id indicates to which
               derivative a given record corresponds. (A derivative in this
               context does not necessary equate with a data set; see the
               definition of the PHASING_MIR_DER dategory for a more
               thorough discussion of the meaning of derivative.)

               It is not necessary for the data items describing the measured
               value of F to appear in this list, as they will already have
               been given in the PHASING_SET_REFLN category. However, these
               items may also be listed here for completeness, if desired.

# by Seth Webster (swebster@mit.edu)

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION
# This is my quick Net Ranger hack.  It is used to scan through
# ASIM transcripts and report the warnings that Net Ranger would
# have reported if it had been in use when the transcript actually
# happened.  Currently, it DOES NOT support triggering on multiple
# occurences of a string.  While the script is running, it prints
# out which file it is working on and the scores for that file.
# The format for the scores is five numbers representing the number
# of one through five warnings that would have been issued for this
# transcript.  The sixth number is the warning value ASIM gave to
# the transcript.  

# OUTPUT FILES
# Two output files are generated : fullResults.txt and scoresOnly.txt.
# The first contains the name of each transcript scanned followed by
# the Net Ranger and ASIM scores followed by each Net Ranger string
# that matched and that string's warning value.  The second file 
# contains one line for each transcript giving the Net Ranger and
# ASIM scores only.

# USAGE
# The arguments to the script are :
#
# script_name <flag1> <flag2> <file list>
#
# where <flag1> indicates whether to output the results to a basline.attack file or a
# baseline.normal file. <flag2> indicates what type of file list is to follow.
# A -f flag means that the next argument is going to be the 
# name of a file containing the names of all of the .dest files.
# A -l flag means that the names of all the .dest files are going
# to be listed on the command line. 


# QUIRKS
# - only the .dest files are named. The .init files must be in
#   the same directory and must have the same base name.
#   e.g.  foo.dest must be accompanied by foo.init
# - the variable $sensordLocation (below) must be set with the
#   name (and path if it isn't in the current directory) of the
#   sensord.conf file from which the script reads the strings
#   and warning values.
# - as I said above, this script does not handle searching for 
#   multiple occurances of a string.
# - this is only the string matching part of Net Ranger, so things
#   like big fingers or sweeps aren't going to show up.


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# this must contain the name of the file containing
# the Net Ranger strings.  If the file isn't in the current
# directory, the full path is needed.

$sensordLocation = "/data/se0/igraf/oldSensord.conf";

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


# open the output files. If you want, you can change these to
# a different name or give them absolute path names.
open (FullInfo, ">fullResults.txt") || 
    die "died on output file\n";
open (ScoresOnly, ">scoresOnly.txt") || 
    die "died on scoresOnly file\n";
open (SingleScore, ">singleScore.txt") ||
    die "died on singleScore file\n";

# get the first argument and see if it is a valid flag


# open either an attack or a normal file for output
    $input2 = shift @ARGV;
    if ($input2 eq "-a") {
	open(Baseline, ">baseline.attack");
    }
    elsif ($input2 eq "-n") {
	open(Baseline, ">baseline.normal");
    }
    else {
	die "Need an -a or -n at beginning of command line";
    }

#  Version 1.1 12/6/94 -- Fixed minor bug which could unpredictably cause a

The spokesperson of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Mahmoud<br>
al-Zahar, released an unprecedented statement from the groups' leadership <br>
today, perhaps the clearest sign of their willingness to negotiate in the<br>
peace process yet seen.<br>
<p>
In his statement, al-Zahar seemed to indicate that the members of<br>
Hamas will not immediately oppose  the Camp David talks that have been<br>
proposed by President Clinton in Washington. He briefly outlined four<br>
aspects of their position.<br>
<p>
First, the Hamas support the full withdrawal of Israeli<br>
troops from Lebanon.  "We are interested in an end to the violent<br>
conflict in Palestine," the release said.  Second, al-Zahar emphasized the<br>
leaderships' resolve not to lose sight of the ultimate goal a Palestinian<br>
state "under the Laws of God."<br>
<p>
Surprisingly, al-Zahar also indicated the Hamas commitment to support the<br>
PLO as they negotiate in Washington, "so long as they do not sacrifice<br>
Palestinian land." This is the position that Sheik Yassin, spiritual<br>
leader of the group, took after being released from an<br>
Israeli prison early in October. It is a clear sign of the group's desire<br>
to keep the Palestinian people undivided in their struggle.<br>
<p>
Finally, al-Zahar was adamant that if anything in the Camp David talks<br>
leads to the removal of Palestinians from their homes, the Hamas will<br>
support a "violent rejection" of it.  Whether this was a veiled threat to<br>
continue with more suicide bombings is still unclear.<br>
<p>
In related news, none of the leaders invited to the Camp David<br>
negotiations have officially accepted President Clinton's offer.  While<br>
there are rumored to be negotiations behind the scenes, TIME magazine has<br>
yet to confirm any of these reports.<br>
<p>
This is Lisa Beyer, reporting for Time Magazine, Jerusalem.<br>

# Typical use:

# This program processes all files on the command line to STDOUT; to process a

Hello to all the children who are starting the HealthNet Exercise Project!
My name is Randi Lite and I am an exercise physiologist. That means I
know about how exercise can help your body. I will be
on-line until your February vacation to answer any questions you may have
about exercise. I am also putting last year's questions about exercise on
the HealthNet web site. There will be a link from the Exercise Project
page called Exercise FAQs - that stands for Frequently Asked Questions.
Can you find the link?? Will you look at last year's questions before you
send me a question to see if it is already on our web site??

I hope you have a great time studying about exercise. I am looking forward
to getting your data about how much exercise you do in a day. Talk with
you soon!

Randi Lite

 * NAME:         reallocate_imatrix_noncontig()

 *	non-contiguous block of memory
 * NOTES:
 *reallocate_imatrix() may not be called after reallocate_imatrix_noncontig()
 *reallocate_imatrix_noncontig() will produce a warning if called to shrink
 *	a matrix.  The matrix will be untouched and no associated memory
 *	will be freed
 * EXAMPLE:
 *	int **pint;
 *	pint = allocate_imatrix(10, 100);
 *	...
 *	pint = reallocate_imatrix_noncontig(pint, 10, 100, 20);

WASHINGTON -- In an exclusive discourse with CNN today, Lebanon President<br>
Elias Hrawi admitted his skepticism of Isreal's offer to withdraw troops<br>
from Southern Lebanon, even though he looks forward to the fulfillment of<br>
such a move from Israel.<br>
<p>
	President Hrawi indicated his curiousity as to whether Israel<br>
really intends to comply with previous UN resolutions or whether this is a<br>
bid by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to salvage his position<br>
and standing within his government.<br>
<p>
	Israel suffered no small amount of embarresment when recently two<br>
Mossad agents were apprehended while attempting to assassinate a high<br>
levelled HAMAS member in Jordan using Canadian passports. <br>
<p>
	President Hrawi noted that discourses were being held with other<br>
groups involved in this matter, including Syria, the Palestinian Authority<br>
and the Islamic Militant group known as Hezbollah.<br>
<p>
	"No group, in the interest of a lasting peace, should be left<br>
out of these talks, and their many conflicting demands reconciled before<br>
we approach the bargaining table."<br>
<p>
	At this present time, it is not known if Prime Minister Netanyahu<br>
has arranged for a specific date and time for talks to begin. Lebanon is<br>
still awaiting a formal invitation to talks from the Israeli government.<br>
<p>
	"I urge Mr. Netanyahu to eschew obsfucation of the current<br>
situation, and remain firm in his intent," said Mr. Hrawi.<br>

    Is in recognition on the optimization send form. 

    Is however, i, that I can't have postscript font font Latex site
    would be by folks The syllables. 
Here is some perl code

#			explot.pl 6.0 18.0 2.0 programmer 'programmer*.ex'
# ONE WEEK:
#			explot.pl 0 168 24.0 programmer 'programmer*.ex'
# DESCRIPTION:
# Times are in hours.
# Creates a scatter plot where time in hours
# is the x axis and the y axis represents
# different user actions or commands that exist in a batch of
# ex files indicated on the command line using regular expressions.
# Remember to keep the shell from expanding the regular expression
# using quotes because perl does this in the script.
# The first argument is minimum time to plot (in hours), the second is 
# the maximum time to plot (in hours), the third is the time step
# for tick marks (in hours), the fourth is prefix used to name
# the plot file, and the last argument is 
# is a regular expression indicating which ex files to use in
# creating the plot.
# 
# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
# 	The plotted commands are built into the script 
#   The program prints out information including a list of
#   the ex files used as processing proceeds.

The spokesperson of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Mahmoud<br>
al-Zahar, released an unprecedented statement from the groups' leadership <br>
today, perhaps the clearest sign of their willingness to negotiate in the<br>
peace process yet seen.<br>
<p>
In his statement, al-Zahar seemed to indicate that the members of<br>
Hamas will not immediately oppose  the Camp David talks that have been<br>
proposed by President Clinton in Washington. He briefly outlined four<br>
aspects of their position.<br>
<p>
First, the Hamas support the full withdrawal of Israeli<br>
troops from Lebanon.  "We are interested in an end to the violent<br>
conflict in Palestine," the release said.  Second, al-Zahar emphasized the<br>
leaderships' resolve not to lose sight of the ultimate goal a Palestinian<br>
state "under the Laws of God."<br>
<p>
Surprisingly, al-Zahar also indicated the Hamas commitment to support the<br>
PLO as they negotiate in Washington, "so long as they do not sacrifice<br>
Palestinian land." This is the position that Sheik Yassin, spiritual<br>
leader of the group, took after being released from an<br>
Israeli prison early in October. It is a clear sign of the group's desire<br>
to keep the Palestinian people undivided in their struggle.<br>
<p>
Finally, al-Zahar was adamant that if anything in the Camp David talks<br>
leads to the removal of Palestinians from their homes, the Hamas will<br>
support a "violent rejection" of it.  Whether this was a veiled threat to<br>
continue with more suicide bombings is still unclear.<br>
<p>
In related news, none of the leaders invited to the Camp David<br>
negotiations have officially accepted President Clinton's offer.  While<br>
there are rumored to be negotiations behind the scenes, TIME magazine has<br>
yet to confirm any of these reports.<br>

WASHINGTON -- It has been three days since United States President Bill Clinton invited<br>
Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to Camp David. The invitation to join the<br>
President there was extended in an effort to further relations and peace-keeping efforts<br>
in the Middle East.<br>
    President Clinton nominated the topics for the discussion to include security measures<br>
in accordance to the Oslo 2 agreements, the future political status of Palestinians,<br>
Jerusalem and the issue of Palestinian refugees. He also mentioned in a press release held<br>
earlier this week that the delegates would be allowed full interaction with other parties<br>
and the media.<br>
    Neither party has yet replied to the invitation, and as yet the intentions of both<br>
parties to accept the offer has not been known.<br>
    Also unknown is the response from Lebanon and Syria regarding Israel's offer to<br>
withdraw troops in Southern Lebanon in exchange for peace. The Israeli troops stationed<br>
themselves in Southern Lebanon in 1985, after invading Lebanon in 1982.<br>

#!/bin/perl

# by Seth Webster (swebster@mit.edu)

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION
# This is my quick Net Ranger hack.  It is used to scan through
# ASIM transcripts and report the warnings that Net Ranger would
# have reported if it had been in use when the transcript actually
# happened.  Currently, it DOES NOT support triggering on multiple
# occurences of a string.  While the script is running, it prints
# out which file it is working on and the scores for that file.
# The format for the scores is five numbers representing the number
# of one through five warnings that would have been issued for this
# transcript.  The sixth number is the warning value ASIM gave to
# the transcript.  

# OUTPUT FILES
# Two output files are generated : fullResults.txt and scoresOnly.txt.
# The first contains the name of each transcript scanned followed by
# the Net Ranger and ASIM scores followed by each Net Ranger string
# that matched and that string's warning value.  The second file 
# contains one line for each transcript giving the Net Ranger and
# ASIM scores only.

# USAGE
# The arguments to the script are :
#
# script_name <flag1> <flag2> <file list>
#
# where <flag1> indicates whether to output the results to a basline.attack file or a
# baseline.normal file. <flag2> indicates what type of file list is to follow.
# A -f flag means that the next argument is going to be the 
# name of a file containing the names of all of the .dest files.
# A -l flag means that the names of all the .dest files are going
# to be listed on the command line. 


# QUIRKS
# - only the .dest files are named. The .init files must be in
#   the same directory and must have the same base name.
#   e.g.  foo.dest must be accompanied by foo.init
# - the variable $sensordLocation (below) must be set with the
#   name (and path if it isn't in the current directory) of the
#   sensord.conf file from which the script reads the strings
#   and warning values.
# - as I said above, this script does not handle searching for 
#   multiple occurances of a string.
# - this is only the string matching part of Net Ranger, so things
#   like big fingers or sweeps aren't going to show up.


# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# this must contain the name of the file containing
# the Net Ranger strings.  If the file isn't in the current
# directory, the full path is needed.

$sensordLocation = "/data/se0/igraf/oldSensord.conf";

# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


# open the output files. If you want, you can change these to
# a different name or give them absolute path names.
open (FullInfo, ">fullResults.txt") || 
    die "died on output file\n";
open (ScoresOnly, ">scoresOnly.txt") || 
    die "died on scoresOnly file\n";
open (SingleScore, ">singleScore.txt") ||
    die "died on singleScore file\n";

# get the first argument and see if it is a valid flag


# open either an attack or a normal file for output
    $input2 = shift @ARGV;
    if ($input2 eq "-a") {
	open(Baseline, ">baseline.attack");
    }

                      Jokes: Your Horse Called!<br>
Daily Humor:<br>
<p>
  This man was sitting quietly reading his paper one morning, peacefully <br>
enjoying himself, when his wife sneaks up behind him and whacks him on the <br>
back of his head with a huge frying pan.  He asks, "What was that for?"<br>
She replies, "What was that piece of paper in your pants pocket with the <br>
name <br>
Marylou written on it?"<br>
<p>
  He says, "Oh honey, remember two weeks ago when I went to the horse races?<br>
Marylou was the name of one of the horses I bet on."<br>
She is appeased and goes off to work around the house.  Three days later <br>
he is <br>
once again sitting in his chair reading and she repeats the frying pan <br>
swatting.<br>
<p>
  He says, "What's that for this time?"<br>
She answered, "Your horse called."<br>

Happy New Year!!

I just got back to the office today and found your questions waiting for me.  Here are the answers.

1. When your dog moans and moves her paws, it probably does mean she's dreaming, but we don't know for sure.  It's tough to answer the question because we can't ask the dogs whether they dream or not, but we think that they are.  They are different than humans though, because when we dream our bodies become paralyzed and we don't move at all!!  That way, we won't hurt ourselves.

2. Sometimes people are still tired after 10 hours of sleep for a couple of possible reasons.  First, if the 10 hours came after nights where you didn't get much sleep, then it could be that you still haven't caught up yet.  If you sleep for too long, then your body adjusts and tries to get even more sleep, so you don't feel like your getting enough.  The trick is to get enough sleep without getting too much sleep.  Ten hours is probably not too much though.  Fourteen or sixteen hours would be.

3. Sometimes people do feel like they took a nap when they simply relax because that's one of the things that sleeping does - it forces you to relax.  As a result, the feeling you get afterwards can be similar.

I hope this answered your questions.
